# Transaction_Management_System

My database schema consisted of three databases which records personal details, branch details and city information respectively. Database is made using SQL. I have used PL SQL for my transaction system where account number and transaction option is asked. According to the input of the user, transactions occur. Lastly the user's current balance is shown and updated in the database.
